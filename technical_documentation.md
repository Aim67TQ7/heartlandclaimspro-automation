# Storm Damage Automation System - Technical Documentation

## System Architecture

The Storm Damage Automation System is built with a modular architecture that allows each component to function independently while also working together as an integrated system. This document provides technical details about the system's architecture, components, and implementation.

## Core Components

### 1. Storm Tracker (`storm_tracker.py`)

The Storm Tracker module monitors weather alerts to identify regions affected by storms.

**Key Features:**
- Integrates with the National Weather Service API
- Filters alerts by severity (Minor, Moderate, Severe, Extreme)
- Extracts geographic boundaries of affected regions
- Stores storm data for historical analysis

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses RESTful API calls to fetch weather alerts
- Parses GeoJSON data to extract storm boundaries
- Implements caching to reduce API calls
- Provides both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces

### 2. Ads Campaign Manager (`ads_campaign_manager.py`)

The Ads Campaign Manager creates targeted Google Ads campaigns for storm-affected regions.

**Key Features:**
- Creates campaigns based on geographic targeting
- Adjusts budget allocation based on storm severity
- Customizes ad content for different storm types
- Tracks campaign performance metrics

**Technical Implementation:**
- Simulates Google Ads API integration (would use actual API in production)
- Implements geotargeting using polygon coordinates
- Uses budget optimization algorithms
- Provides campaign creation and management functions

### 3. Photo Collection API (`photo_collection_api.py`)

The Photo Collection API allows contractors to submit photos of storm damage.

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API for photo uploads
- User authentication and authorization
- Metadata collection for each photo
- Job management for contractors

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built with Flask web framework
- Implements secure file uploads with validation

### 4. Photo App Simulator (`photo_app_simulator.py`)

The Photo App Simulator provides a testing interface for the Photo Collection API.

**Key Features:**
- Simulates mobile app functionality
- Interactive command-line interface
- Automated testing capabilities

**Technical Implementation:**
- Python-based CLI application
- Uses requests library for API communication
- Implements both interactive and scripted modes

### 5. Damage Assessment (`damage_assessment.py`)

The Damage Assessment module analyzes photos to identify and classify storm damage.

**Key Features:**
- Processes submitted photos
- Identifies damage types (roof, siding, structural, water, debris)
- Generates detailed damage reports
- Prepares data for Xactimate integration

**Technical Implementation:**
- Simulates AI image analysis (would use actual computer vision in production)
- Generates realistic damage assessments with severity scores
- Creates Xactimate-compatible measurements
- Provides job summary generation

### 6. Xactimate Integration (`xactimate_integration.py`)

The Xactimate Integration module creates and submits insurance claims.

**Key Features:**
- Formats damage data for Xactimate
- Creates line items for different damage types
- Submits claims to Xactimate
- Tracks claim status

**Technical Implementation:**
- Simulates Xactimate API integration (would use actual API in production)
- Implements claim formatting according to Xactimate standards
- Provides claim submission and status tracking
- Generates detailed claim reports

### 7. Payment Processing (`payment_processing.py`)

The Payment Processing module handles payments to contractors.

**Key Features:**
- Processes payments for approved claims
- Calculates contractor payment amounts
- Generates payment reports
- Notifies contractors about payments

**Technical Implementation:**
- Simulates payment processing (would integrate with actual payment systems in production)
- Implements payment calculation algorithms
- Provides payment tracking and reporting
- Includes contractor notification system

## Integration and Testing

### Integration Test (`integration_test.py`)

The Integration Test module verifies the complete system workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Tests each component individually
- Tests the complete workflow end-to-end
- Generates test reports
- Simulates real-world scenarios

**Technical Implementation:**
- Creates mock data for testing
- Implements comprehensive test cases
- Provides detailed logging of test results
- Supports both individual component testing and full workflow testing

### Deployment Script (`deploy.py`)

The Deployment Script handles system setup and service management.

**Key Features:**
- Checks and installs dependencies
- Creates necessary directories
- Runs integration tests
- Starts required services

**Technical Implementation:**
- Manages Python dependencies
- Implements service management
- Provides deployment status reporting
- Supports various deployment options

## Data Flow

The system follows a sequential data flow:

1. **Storm Detection**: The Storm Tracker identifies regions affected by storms and stores the data.
2. **Campaign Creation**: The Ads Campaign Manager uses the storm data to create targeted campaigns.
3. **Photo Collection**: Contractors respond to ads and submit photos through the Photo Collection API.
4. **Damage Analysis**: The Damage Assessment module processes the photos and identifies damage.
5. **Claim Submission**: The Xactimate Integration module creates and submits insurance claims.
6. **Payment Processing**: The Payment Processing module handles payments to contractors.

## Data Storage

The system uses a file-based storage system with the following directory structure:

```
data/
├── storm_data/         # Storm tracking data
├── photo_uploads/      # Uploaded photos
│   └── metadata/       # Photo metadata
├── damage_reports/     # Damage assessment reports
├── xactimate_claims/   # Xactimate claim data
└── payment_records/    # Payment records
```

Each component stores its data in JSON format for easy interoperability.

## API Endpoints

The Photo Collection API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/contractor/login`: Contractor login endpoint
- `GET /api/contractor/jobs`: Get active jobs for a contractor
- `POST /api/photos/upload`: Upload a photo of storm damage
- `GET /api/photos/<job_id>`: Get all photos for a specific job
- `GET /api/photos/view/<job_id>/<filename>`: View a specific photo

## Security Considerations

In a production environment, the system would implement the following security measures:

- HTTPS for all API communications
- JWT-based authentication for contractors
- Input validation for all user-submitted data
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Encryption for sensitive data

## Performance Optimization

The system includes several performance optimizations:

- Caching of weather API responses
- Efficient file storage and retrieval
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Batch processing for damage assessment
- Optimized database queries (in a production environment)

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be easily extended:

- Modular architecture allows for component replacement
- Well-defined interfaces between components
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- Real-time notifications for contractors
- Machine learning for damage assessment accuracy improvement
- Integration with additional insurance systems
- Mobile app development for contractors
- Dashboard for system monitoring and management
- Automated scaling based on storm activity

## Development Guidelines

For developers extending or maintaining the system:

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Write comprehensive unit tests for new features
- Update documentation when making changes
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## Conclusion

The Storm Damage Automation System provides a comprehensive solution for automating the storm damage assessment and insurance claim process. This technical documentation should provide developers with the information needed to understand, maintain, and extend the system.
